# UnBound X Content Moderation Engine

## Project Overview
A cost-efficient, scalable content moderation system using layered filtering: deterministic rules, lightweight ML, and minimal AI. All moderation flows through a unified controller (GuardianAI) for explainability and tunable thresholds.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, scikit-learn, HuggingFace Transformers, gensim, SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)
